# Vulnerability Scanning with MSF
### Objective
Exploring process of performing vulnerability scans with **Metasploit framework**

#### Lab environment
- Metasploitable3
#### Vulnerability Scanning
- The process of scanning a target system for vulnerabilities.
- Verifying whether these vulnerablities can be exploited.
#### Demo
\* Target machine on same local network  

**Step 1**  
Identifyig target IP
`-sn` quick ping
```bash
sudo nmap -sn 10.10.10.1/24
```
-> shows 2 VM IPs (Target and my own)
To identify target IP, run
```bash
ip a s
```
to check IP address attacking with.

**Step 2**
Ensure PostSQL database service started
Then start Metasploit framework console
```bash
msfconsole
```
Check if database is connected
```bash
db_status
```
Should see
```bash
Connected to msf. Connection type: postgresql.
```
Set variable **globally**
-> target IP always configured
```bash
setg RHOSTS 10.10.10.4
```
```bash
setg RHOST 10.10.10.4
```
Create workspace (name: MS3)
```bash
workspace -a MS3
```
Sin scan, service detection, version detection and operating system detection
```bash
db_nmap -sS -sV -O 10.10.10.4
```




Memo
Required info to identify vulnerabilities: service version


#### ðŸ“‚ Terms I looked up
`PostgreSQL`  
An opensource Relational Database Management System  
Similar to MySQL but more advanced feature  
Why it shows up in Metasploit  
-> Metasploit uses PostgreSQL as its default backend database to store:  
- Scan results
- Loot (found creds etc)
- Exploit info, session, workspace history
